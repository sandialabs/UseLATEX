This test checks that command line arguments can be set using the
COMPILE_FLAGS property on the dvi and pdf targets. The test adds an
`-output-directory` flag to the compile to redirect the output files to the
`output-files` subdirectory.

Note that this test compile flag messes up the file dependencies used by
CMake and the build program. The build will happen every time even if it
does not need to. It also messes up dependent builds such as making the ps
from the dvi (since the dvi is not created where expected). But it will
indicate whether the argument is added successfully by where the output
files are created.
